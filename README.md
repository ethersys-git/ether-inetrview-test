Thank you for applying for the Web Engineer position @Ether Daylight Systems. As a part of our interview process, we conduct a basic JS competency test for initially selected candidates, and you are one of them!

The main goal of this exercise is to assess your approach to problem solving, as well as your ability to write clean and reusable code.

## Here is your test.

Please see the attached design folder for your assignment. Your Job is to generate this EXACT same output. Please see the following constraints;

1. Use only: HTML, CSS & JavaScript or Reactjs (No jQuery, No animation libraries and No canvas)
2. Submit within 48 hours.
3. Upload it to Google Drive/Github and send a link on Gmail. 

## The Assignment

Your assignment is to build out this bar chart component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
We provide the data for the chart in a local `data.json` file. So you can use that to dynamically add the bars if you choose.

Your users should be able to:
- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day's bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See dynamically generated bars based on the data provided in the local JSON file
- **Bonus**: Use React js.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 
The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

## Submitting your solution
